        <h2>⚜Claude Faustus⚜</h2>
        <p>Claud is Alois's demon butler, mutch like Ciel and Sebastiain, Alois madea deal with Claud to save him from his bad situation and restor his manor. unlike ciel, Alois is very dependent on claus. Appearing in almost the same way Sebastian Michaelis did to Ciel, Claude forms a contract with Alois and chooses to serve him as his butler. Time passes, and the next seen of the pair is during a sudden visit of Arnold Trancy, Alois' uncle, to the manor. Under his master's order, Claude restores the mansion to the way it was before Earl Trancy's demise, thus helping Alois keep the facade of actually caring for his father. </p>

        <p>Angela Blanc, also known as Ash Landers was a maid at Alois's manor, where she was abused by him. She sometimes takes the form of a man named Ash, making her great genderfluid representation. Algela is one of the main antagonist of the anime adaptation of Black Butler. She appears as one of the two main antagonists of the first season (along with her alter-ego Ash Landers) and a posthumous antagonist in the second season. </p>
